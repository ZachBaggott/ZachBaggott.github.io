These are the prime times to fish for them, but you can still catch them all year round. The majority of the Bull Trout don't have a perpouse to head up the rivers as others do. Even tho the majority dont have a perpouse, they still make there way up stream because a bunch of the bull trout are. They eventually make there way down.</h4> </div>

 <div class="paragraph">
        <h4> Cutthroat trout are the main fish in the elk river, most people come to the elk river to catch cutthroat trout. What makes cutthroat trout fun to catch is that you can catch them on dry flies. dry flies are flies that float on the top of the water instead of sinking. Elk river is known to be one of the best dry fly fisheries in BC. Cutthroat are around all year long, which makes them the main fish of the elk river.</h4>

        <div class="paragraph">
        <h4>Rockie Mountain Whitefish are are not a huge part of the fishing in Fernie. These fish dont mainly go for dry flies or a big streamer which makes it so people dont try to catch them that much. all though you dont catch Whitefish most of the season, there is a pariod were you will catch more Whitefish than Bull trout or Cutthroat trout. In the early part of the season when the water is pretty high and nimphs are the main type of fly to use, Whitefish is what you will probably be catching. These fish dont get cought much but I think that there an important part of the fernie area because it means you can start fishing earlier and still cath a decent amount of fish.</h4>
