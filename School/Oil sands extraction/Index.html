Oil sands mining is a very good and efficient way. Oil sands mining is a process when you extract bitchuman (viscous oil) between sand particles. And put it through a process that makes it usable oil to use, make, and do several things such as, powering your car, make household items that you use every day, make roads, make tires, and so much more. There are three processes in oil sands mining to get usable oil. The three processes are

        1.Mining- In the mining process, big machines scoop up the sand and bitchumen into big dump trucks. The dump trucks then pour the sand and bitchuman into a crusher. The crusher breaks down big pieces of sand and bitchumen to prepare it for transport and for the extraction process. There are several ways to transport the sand and bitchuman but the most common is to push it through a pipe with water at a high pressure, this is called hydro transport. After the sand and bitchumen is hydro transported, it ends up in an extraction vessel for the extraction process.

        2.Extraction- In the extraction vessel, hot water is added to the bitchuman and sand. The hot water makes the bitchumen less dense and float to the top, the sand goes to the bottom. This separates the sand and bitchumen, sometimes they do this procedure twice to improve the quality of the bitchumen. Then the bitchumen is removed from the extraction vessel and transported to an upgrader to get it ready for use.

        3.Tailings Management- Although tailings management is not really a part that people think of when getting the oil sands to be usable oil, tailings management is a big part. When the bitchumen is moved from the extraction vessel to the upgrader there is still sand and hot water in the extraction vessel. This sand and hot water is moved to a tailings pond where the water and sand separates. This allows the water to be reused in the extraction vessel. About 75% of the water can be reused in a tailings pond and after the tailings pond has been used for a while they can cover it up with solid to let trees and plants regrow, also becoming a part of the animals habitat. This seems like a very environmentally good thing, the process is the least environmentally friendly part of oil sands mining. This is discussed in the environmental section.

        <h2>
         When the people at oil sands mines are done with using the land for a tailings pond, they are able to cover it up with soil to allow trees to grow on the land and wildlife can live in these areas as well. Through the use of tailings ponds, they can recycle 75% of the water used in the extraction vessel. This is very environmentally friendly and also helps save a lot of money.

        The tailings ponds seem like a very environmentally friendly part of oil sands mining but it is the opposite. When the sand and water is moved from the extraction vessel to a tailings pond, there is still some oil left in the water and sand that gets dumped in the tailings pond. That's why most of the pond is black in the tailings pond picture. These tailings ponds get really big which means more oil builds up in them.  Ducks then land on the oil and get stuck leaving them to die. Some solutions to try and stop this are putting up several scare crows and putting more fresh water in the ponds before they put the extra stuff from the extraction vessel in. These never really worked as the ducks usually ignored the scare crows and the extra oil was still warm which made it less dense than the water so it floated to the top.
