        <h4>The Elk river is the main river in Fernie BC. This river is open most of the year but will sometimes be closed for a month or 2 pending on the conditions around june and april. Before the river closes (if it does) it is usualy still pretty high and not fishable. The best time to fish the river is in the fall. In the fall the river has lots of Bull trout, Cutthroat trout, and some Rockie Mountain whitefish.</h4>

        <h4>Coal Creek is a big part of fishing in Fernie. Coal creek has a very short season as it dries out quick and becomes not very good fishing. When the Elk river is high and mircy, this is where the fishing is. When the fishing is good hear its mainly on nymphs and slowly changes to dry flies as the river starts to dry up. There is a period were the river is to high to fish but changes very quickly.</h4>
